## Multi-Model Recommendation Algorithm System
# Groceryrec_sys(Grocery store recommendation system base on ML model)
# Project Overview
This system is designed to build a multi-model recommendation algorithm that combines several collaborative filtering techniques to generate product recommendations for online store users. The system integrates multiple models, including SVD, KNN, and NMF, to optimize the recommendation accuracy by evaluating and ranking model performance using RMSE.

# Features
Collaborative Filtering Models: Combines user-based collaborative filtering techniques such as SVD, KNN, and NMF.
Data Mining: Uses association rule mining (Apriori algorithm) to identify frequently purchased items and recommend items based on shopping trends.
Prediction Evaluation: Measures model accuracy with RMSE and ranks the models accordingly to select the best one.
User Personalization: Provides tailored product recommendations for individual users by analyzing historical purchasing behavior.

# Models
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
SVD decomposes the user-item matrix into latent factors to generate recommendations. It provides personalized recommendations by predicting the rating a user would give to unrated items.

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
KNN uses cosine similarity to find users or items that are most similar to each other. Based on these similarities, it predicts a userâ€™s potential interest in unrated items.

NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)
NMF decomposes the user-item matrix into non-negative matrices. It uses matrix factorization to generate recommendations, ensuring all values remain non-negative, which makes it suitable for certain types of data.

# Evaluation
The models are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of predictions. RMSE helps determine which model provides the most accurate recommendations.

# Results
Based on RMSE evaluation:

SVD: The best-performing model, with high accuracy in predicting user preferences.
KNN: Second best, but struggles with cold-start problems and sparse datasets.
NMF: Tends to get stuck in local optima and requires more tuning.
Future Improvements
Data Diversity: Incorporate more diverse user and product data to further enhance recommendation accuracy.
Algorithm Optimization: Experiment with additional collaborative filtering algorithms and fine-tune model parameters.
Scalability: Optimize the system for handling large datasets to ensure faster recommendations.
